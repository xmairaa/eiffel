# The Links Object
The __links__ object is an array of trace links to other Eiffel events. These trace links by definition always reference backwards in time â€“ it is only possible to reference an event that has already occurred. Each trace link is a tuple consisting of a type and a UUID corresponding to the __meta.id__ of the target event, on String format.

Some link types allow multiple trace links, whereas others only allow one.

Example syntax of a simple __links__ object:

    "links": [
      {"type": "CAUSE", "target": "8f3e0f94-5d11-46e7-ae02-91efa15d2329"},
      {"type": "COMPOSITION", "target": "43ee71d2-6d91-496a-b9cf-d121ff1d1bcf"}
    ]

The full list of optional and required links is described in the documentation of each respective event type.
